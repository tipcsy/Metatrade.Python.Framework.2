## Usage Example

```python
import asyncio
from src.core.config.settings import Settings
from src.core.backend_service import BackendService

async def main():
    # Create settings
    settings = Settings(...)  # Configure your settings

    # Create and start backend service
    async with BackendService(settings) as backend:
        # Service automatically starts and stops

        # Check health
        health = await backend.health_check()
        print(f"System healthy: {health['overall_healthy']}")

        # Get metrics
        metrics = await backend.get_service_metrics()
        print(f"Data processed: {metrics['backend_service']['data_points_processed']}")

        # Keep running
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

# Run the service
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Application settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
APP_NAME=MetaTraderFramework

# MT5 settings
MT5_LOGIN=12345678

### Optimization Recommendations
- Tune worker thread counts based on CPU cores
- Adjust batch sizes based on memory availability
- Configure connection pools for expected load
- Monitor and tune database query performance
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
